        <h1>What is Formula Student?</h1>
        <p>Formula Student is an international engineering competition where student teams from around the world design, build, test, and race small formula-style racing cars. The competition is judged on various aspects, including engineering design, cost and manufacturing analysis, business presentation, and dynamic events such as acceleration, skid pad, autocross, and endurance.</p> 
        <p>Participants and members of the Formula Student community gain hands-on experience in industrial engineering practices, project management, manufacturing processes, and team collaboration, making Formula Student a highly regarded and rewarding challenge for aspiring engineers.</p>

        <h1>DJS Racing</h1>
        <p>DJS Racing is one of the Formula Student team under the University of Mumbai. Since their founding, DJS Racing has established themselves as one of the best teams nationally. The team has won several accolades in national and international events, and has set themselves up as a measure of excellence in all static events. Alumni of the team often serve as judges in future competitions.</p>
        <p>Since 2020, the team has made a shift from Combustion Vehicles to the Electric and Autonomous Category. Their first EV car debuted at Formula Bharat 2022.</p>

        <h1>Structural Head</h1>
        <p>I joined the team as a junior member of the chassis team and was later promoted to the position of Structural Head. In this capacity I oversaw the shift from a combustion vehicle to an electric design. I headed the production of two chassis for our cars and actively participated in the design and manufacture of our aerodynamic package.</p> 
        <p>Under my leadership, DJS Racing successfully defended their cost budget and cost design for two years, securing a rank in the top five. I led the design and prototyping of a modular firewall and a carbon fibre impact attenuator, both of which have since been patented by our university. I also published a paper on efficient use of Carbon Fibre in my final year. </p>

        <h1>Finance Lead</h1>
        <p>I joined the B-team of the Business Plan group in my first year in the team. My skills in financial modelling and designing presentations allowed the B-Team to secure a national rank of fourth. In this event I developed and defended a solid financial model for our "firm", which garnered an honorable mention from the judges.</p> 
        <p>Subsequently I was put in charge of the finances of the Business Plan team and served as co-lead for the event. During my stint as the head, we secured a national rank of 2, narrowly being beaten by IIT Bombay in that event. The financial templates I developed then are still in use by the team.</p>

        <h1>Inspection and Test Driver</h1>
        <p>Having been an active participant in the design and manufacturing of two cars, I was made the Inspection and Testing driver in my final year. I successfully demonstrated driver safety during Vehicle Inspection and gained approval for all track events.</p> 
        <p>The entire Vehicle Inspection was cleared by the team in record time that year. In particular focus were our modular firewall that allowed easy disassembly for accessing the accumulator, and our in-house carbon fibre impact attenuator which protected the driver during frontal crashes.</p>
