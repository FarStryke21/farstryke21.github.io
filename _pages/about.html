    Hey there! Thanks for visiting my page! My name is Aman, and currently I am a Researcher at Carnegie Mellon University. My specialization is in the field of Robotics. I work under Dr. Kenji Shimada in the Computational Engineering and Robotics Lab. Here, I work on developing state of the art inspection pipelines using robots, integrate software and hardware so stuff works correctly, and develop new reconstruction and classification methods using point clouds and images.    
  </p>
  <p>
    I completed my Master’s degree from CMU with a focus on robotics and controls. While working on my thesis regarding usage of reinforcement learning methods to solve the viewpoint planning problems, I became well-versed with computer vision and its importance in modern systems. Being a CMU graduate today comes with the assurance that I know the ins and outs of machine learning algorithms and have hands on experience in implementing them. One of my projects currently focuses on developing semantic intelligence in a robot arm to carry out task provided in a high-level command formats like “Get me a coffee cup”.

    This webpage houses details on my work. I have kept the details fairly easy to read, and technical audience are welcome to contact me for more details of my work!
