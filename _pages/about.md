Greetings and welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a curated collection of my creative endeavors, reflective of a journey fueled by passion, dedication, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. I believe that every project is a canvas, an opportunity to tell a story, evoke emotion, or solve a problem. With a foundation in Mechanical Engineering, I've embarked on a quest to blend artistry with functionality, crafting experiences that resonate with their intended audience.

As you peruse through these pages, I invite you to explore the narrative woven into each project. Behind every design, every line of code, lies a story waiting to be discovered. From building robots that can work independently on ships, to creating algorithms to mimic the efficacy of our eyes, each piece encapsulates a part of my creative journey.

I'm excited to share these experiences with you and eager to hear how they resonate with you. Whether you're seeking a collaborator for your next project or simply intrigued by the stories behind the work, I'm here to connect and explore new possibilities. If you have any specific details you'd like to include or if there's a particular aspect you'd like to emphasize, please let me know!

My research centers on the dynamic interplay between robotics and computer science. This intersection holds the promise of creating intelligent, adaptable machines that interact seamlessly with the physical world. I focus on developing cutting-edge algorithms and computational models, from machine learning for adaptive behavior to computer vision for robust perception. Beyond technical prowess, I'm keenly interested in the ethical and societal implications of this technology. Through a multidisciplinary approach, I aim to advance control algorithms for dynamic locomotion and explore human-robot interaction paradigms. Ultimately, I seek to not only contribute to academic discourse but also to drive tangible applications that redefine industries and enhance everyday life.

Collaboration with fellow researchers and innovators who share this passion for pushing boundaries is a prospect I eagerly anticipate. At present, I am a graduate researcher at the Computational Engineering and Robotics Lab (CERLAB) under the guidance of Professor Kenji Shimada at Carnegie Mellon University. My work here primarily focuses on metrology and inspection applications of manipulator robots. From solving the coverage path planning problem, to developing solutions for better pointcloud registration, my work here allows me to push beyond my limits, establising new targets for me on a daily basis.
