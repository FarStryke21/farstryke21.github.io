Welcome to my portfolio, where engineering meets creativity! Here, you'll find a collection of projects reflecting a journey driven by precision and innovation. With a background in Mechanical Engineering, I've focused on blending technical expertise with practical design, crafting solutions that are both functional and elegant.

Each project in this portfolio is a testament to problem-solving and ingenuity. From autonomous maritime robots to algorithmic simulations of human vision, I've tackled diverse challenges with a methodical approach and attention to detail.

I'm excited to share these experiences with you and discuss the technical aspects behind each project. Whether you're looking for a collaborator or simply intrigued by the engineering behind the work, I'm here to connect and explore new opportunities. If you have specific technical questions or areas of interest, feel free to reach out!

My research delves into the dynamic convergence of robotics and computer science, promising the creation of intelligent machines adept at seamless interaction with the physical realm. I specialize in high precision robotics applications and computational models, ranging from adaptive behavior through machine learning to robust perception via computer vision. Beyond technical exploration, I am deeply engaged in the ethical and societal ramifications of this technological advancement. 

I eagerly anticipate collaboration with fellow researchers and innovators who share my commitment to pushing boundaries. Presently, I serve as a graduate researcher at the Computational Engineering and Robotics Lab (CERLAB), under the mentorship of Professor Kenji Shimada at Carnegie Mellon University. My current focus lies in metrology and inspection applications of manipulator robots. From tackling the coverage path planning challenge to devising solutions for enhanced point cloud registration, my work continually propels me beyond conventional limits, establishing new benchmarks with each endeavor. My current work in high fidelity pose estimation for models and quality analysis with confidence is a part of the Metrology Project at CERLAB, funded and requistioned by NASA.
