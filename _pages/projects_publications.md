### Marine Vessel Operational Support Robot (BlackFlag)

      Developed as a part of the semester long mechatronics capstone projects, the BlackFlag utility robot was an innovative solution to operational support for large marine vessels. The problem statement defined the requirement of a system which could carry on routine inspections and perform complex operations on board cargo vessels, while being immune to this rugged environment. The blackflag robot featured a 5 DOF revolute arm on a mobile base, coupled with a custom perception package. This project was developed as a five member team, where I was responsible for the Perception and Sensing Subsystem for the robot, and was incharge of the overall software integration and final deployment of the functional system. The link below specifies more details for the BlackFlag robot, and the repository holds the software package deployed on the microprocessor

      High-performance racing has always been an exciting and challenging field, where the goal is to achieve the fastest possible lap time around the track. In Formula One (F1) racing, drivers and engineers continuously search for ways to optimize the performance of their cars and outpace their competitors. One approach to improving lap times is to use optimal control strategies, which aim to find the most efficient path a racing car can take around the track. In this paper, we explore the use of optimal control strategies to model the most efficient path for a racing car to optimize its lap time around F1 circuits. Specifically, we focus on one of the iconic circuits: Monza in Italy. (Part of Optimal Control and Reinforcement Learning Capstone)

### Panel Gap Identification for Automobiles

      Panel gaps in automobiles refer to the spaces or misalignments between adjacent body panels. They are important to address because they affect the vehicle's aesthetics, structural integrity, and aerodynamics. Well-aligned panels also contribute to better water and dust resistance, reduce noise, and enhance resale value. Automobile manufacturers spend millions each fiscal year on recalling and repairing cars with panel gap errors. To address this problem, a novel solution which identified and classified panel gap defects using a stereo depth camera on the shop floor was prototyped. Our team of three successfully demonstrated our prototypes and defended our work against a panel of our peers and intructors. (Part of the Computer Vision Capstone)

### Visual Odometry through RNNs

      The standard pipeline for performing visual odometry includes feature extraction, camera calibration,local optimisation etc. Thus some prior knowledge of system is required to recover absolute trajectory. However,a RNN+CNN model can be used to infer poses directly without this prior knowledge. This report presents comparison between the conventional method (geometry-based odometry) used for monocular visual odometry with an end-to-end trained RNN+CNN model for trajectory estimation and verifies the viability of the end-to-end model over traditional visual odometry systems.

      Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.
