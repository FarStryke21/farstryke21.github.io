<p>Welcome to my collection of starter code projects for various robotic applications. These projects are designed to help new students learning robotics and provide a starting playground for experimentation and learning.</p>

<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Provide accessible starting points for students new to robotics</li>
    <li>Offer a playground for experimentation and learning</li>
    <li>Cover a wide range of robotic applications</li>
    <li>Encourage open-source collaboration in robotics education</li>
</ul>


<div class="project">
    <h2>Robot Arms</h2>
    <p>This repository contains starter code for robot arm applications. It includes basic kinematics, control algorithms, and simulation environments to help students get started with manipulator robotics.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/FarStryke21/arm_ws">GitHub Repository: Robot Arms Starter Code</a></p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs)</h2>
    <p>The UGV repository provides a foundation for working with wheeled or tracked robots. It includes code for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and basic autonomy features.</p>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Robot Dog (In Progress)</h2>
    <p>I'm currently developing a starter code repository for quadruped robots, often referred to as "robot dogs". This project will include gait generation, balance control, and basic motion planning for legged robots.</p>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Drone (In Progress)</h2>
    <p>Another ongoing project is the development of starter code for drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This repository will cover flight control, stabilization, and basic autonomous flight capabilities.</p>
