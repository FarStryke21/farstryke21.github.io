<p>
    The teleoperation project was commissioned as part of an effort to develop
    solutions for automated factories where routine maintenance is a
    requirement. One half of the wheeled robot inspection system which has been
    planned, the manipulator teleoperation project aims to develop solutions for
    precise control of robot arms, controlled by an operator at a remote
    location. The operator may utilize a guided mode for controlling the arm, or
    a full manual mode to control the arm without assistance.
</p>

<p>
    My teleoperation package represents a cutting-edge solution for remote
    robotic control, designed to provide precise, safe, and intuitive
    manipulation of robotic systems across various environments. By leveraging
    advanced communication technologies and user-centric design, the package
    enables operators to perform complex tasks from a safe distance.
</p>

<h2>Teleoperation Architecture</h2>

<p>
    The teleoperation architecture has undergone a significant evolution,
    transitioning from a ROS1-based centralized system to a more sophisticated
    ROS2-based decentralized framework. This evolution reflects the growing
    demands for more flexible and robust robotic control systems.

    <div class="image-caption">ROS1-Based Centralized Architecture: Focused on
        velocity control with straightforward implementation</div>
</div>

<p>
    The initial ROS1 architecture implemented a straightforward approach,
    channeling multiple input devices through a centralized client node. This
    design prioritized simplicity and ease of implementation, though it was
    limited to velocity-based control. The server-side components formed a
    linear pipeline from command processing through to robot execution, making
    it highly reliable but somewhat inflexible.
</p>

        alt="ROS2 Based Architecture">
    <div class="image-caption">ROS2-Based Decentralized Architecture: Advanced
        multi-modal control system</div>
</div>

<p>
    The transition to ROS2 brought a paradigm shift in the control architecture.
    The new design introduces a sophisticated servo abstraction layer that
    supports multiple command modalities - joint control, pose control, and
    velocity control. This flexibility allows operators to choose the most
    appropriate control scheme for their specific task. The decentralized nature
    of the system, combined with the custom servo package, enables more complex
    operations while maintaining system stability and responsiveness.
</p>

<p>
    While the newer architecture demands more initial setup and offers limited
    support compared to its predecessor, its advanced functionality and flexible
    control options make it a more powerful solution for modern robotics
    applications. The evolution represents a shift from a "one-size-fits-all"
    approach to a more adaptable and capable system.
</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>
    The teleoperation system has been successfully deployed across multiple
    industrial inspection scenarios, demonstrating its versatility and precision
    in quality control applications. This is done by swapping the sensor pack on the robot end-effector.
