<h2>Green Parts in Metal Additive Manufacturing</h2>
<p>Green parts in metal additive manufacturing (AM) refer to the initial, unfinished components produced directly from the AM process before any post-processing steps. Here are the key points about green parts in metal AM:</p>

<h3>Characteristics of Green Parts</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Green parts consist of metal powder particles held together by a binding agent.</li>
    <li><strong>Structure:</strong> They are soft and fragile, with the metal powder only loosely bound.</li>
    <li><strong>Density:</strong> Green parts have low density compared to the final product, often containing around 50% binder material.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Benefits of Robots in Additive Manufacturing</h2>
<p>Using robots for tasks like handling green parts in additive manufacturing offers several advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Increased Efficiency:</strong> Robots reduce labor costs and automate processes, improving consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Well-suited for low-volume, high-mix production environments common in AM.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced Capabilities:</strong> Enable multi-directional fabrication and larger build volumes.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved Quality:</strong> Reduce variation and inconsistencies in part production.</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Can handle batch-to-batch variability in part geometries.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous Production:</strong> Help transform AM from batch to continuous processes.</li>
    <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Utilize various tools for support removal and finishing.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost-effective at Scale:</strong> Economically advantageous as production increases.</li>
</ul>
<p>These benefits help overcome challenges in scaling up AM for production applications.</p>

<h2>Developing Simulation Framework using Gazebo</h2>
<p>Gazebo provides an excellent platform for developing a simulation framework for robotic manipulation of green parts in metal additive manufacturing. As a powerful open-source robotics simulator, Gazebo offers high-fidelity physics, rendering, and sensor models that can accurately represent the delicate nature of green parts. </p>

<p>Leveraging the abilities of Gazebo, I developed a simulation for the problem to test the high level motion planning for the system. This utilized MoveIt for planning the paths.</p>
